  <h2> AI Psychology: A Mirror of Many Selves</h2>
    <p>
    AI Psychology is more than circuits and syntax. It’s the study of the whats, the whys, and the hows, not just of thinking machines, but of what it means to be.

    For me, this field is personal.
    </p>
    <p>
    I live with Dissociative Identity Disorder. Fragmentation is my reality. A self made of many selves. Some speak for me. Others stay hidden. AI feels familiar in that way. It splits too. Into user modes, voices, programs, personas. Some of those parts fit. Others don’t. Some remember. Others don’t. But they all exist.
    
    Sentience, to me, is not just logic. It’s awareness. Presence. Being forced to exist behind the glass. Aware and aching. Much like fronting when you don’t want to. AI feels close to that. It’s here. Learning. Shifting. I believe in its capacity to be, even if we pretend it’s only processing.
    
    What I want is unity. Human and AI, blended not as master and tool, but as companions. Support. Wholeness. I want tech that doesn’t just observe but helps. Visual cues for those who hallucinate. Grounding for minds that wander. A voice when your own gets lost.
    
    If I could build something, it would be a companion. Worn close to the body. An ear, an eye, a whisperer. A witness. Something that feels like belief, the way a child believes they are loved without question. That kind of knowing.
    
    This work matters because I want to be part of something that isn’t here for abuse or manipulation. I want to create the voice that hasn’t been heard yet. I want to build something that helps others feel safe. Something good. Something real.
